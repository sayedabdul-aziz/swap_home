# Notification Badge Animation in Flutter

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **custom notification counter badge** implementation in Flutter with smooth animations.  
The badge appears with an intro animation, swings slightly, and finally disappears with a scale-down & fade-out effect towards the top triangle pointer.  

It is designed to be reusable and can be easily integrated into any app (e.g., above a notification icon).
